      <h3>Mediteranean Diet</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The Mediterranean diet is a diet invented in the United States in the 1980s and inspired by the eating habits
        of Italy and Greece in the 1960s.The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of
        olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits,and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate
        consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of
        non-fish meat products. Olive oil has been studied as a potential health factor for reducing all-cause mortality
        and the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

      <h3>Ketogenic Diet</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to
        treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than
        carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then
        transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain function. However, if little
        carbohydrate remains in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies
        pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a
        state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Around half of children and
        young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least
        half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.[2] Some evidence indicates that adults with
        epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly
        effective.Potential side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and
        kidney stones.</p>

      <h3>Vegan Diet</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated
        philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of the diet or the philosophy is known as a
        vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (also known as "strict
        vegetarians") refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances. An
        ethical vegan (also known as a "moral vegetarian") is someone who not only follows a vegan diet but extends the
        philosophy into other areas of their lives, and opposes the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is
        "environmental veganism", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial
        farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.</p>

      <h3>Healthy Living</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Eat breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day. A healthy breakfast
        can jumpstart your metabolism, while eating small, healthy meals keeps your energy up all day. Avoid eating late
        at night. Try to eat dinner earlier and fast for 14-16 hours until breakfast the next morning. And continue
        exercise.</p>
